    <h1 style="text-align: center;">Iron and Manganese Study Guide</h1><br>
    <h3>Quick Facts</h3><br>
    <ul>
    <li>The chemical symbol for iron is <strong>Fe</strong>.</li><br>
    <li>The chemical symbol for manganese is <strong>Mn</strong>.</li><br>
    <li>Iron and manganese do not have a Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) but they do have a Secondary MCL for aesthetics:</li><br>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0">
    <td>Fe</td>
    <td>0.3 ppm</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mn</td>
    <td>0.05 ppm</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Fe & Mn Combined</td>
    <td>0.3 ppm</td>
  </tr>
</table><br><br>
    </ul>
    <h3>Aesthetic Problems</h3><br>
    <ul>
    <li>Iron can precipitate out causing red water, and manganese can precipitate out causing black water.  
    These discolorations tend to stain plumbing fixtures and laundry</li><br>
    <li>Higher levels of iron and manganese can impart taste and odor problems to water</li><br>
    <li>Precipitation of these metals can clog ion exchangers used for water softening.</li><br>
    <li>Iron in water spoils the taste and color of vegitables, coffee and tea.</li><br>
    <li>Iron in water promotes the growth of iron bacteria</li><br>
    </ul>
    <h3>Iron Bacteria</h3><br>
    <p>Bacteria that use iron as an energy source are called "iron bacteria".  Their formation of large, slimy masses can clog well screens, pumps and other equipment.  
    Depositing this sticky slime wherever they exist, iron bacteria can reduce the carrying capacity of pipes.  This deposit consists of iron and manganese oxides and 
    masses of bacteria.  They can slough off gradually and be carried into homes.  Iron bacteria are filamentous (occurring in a long series and attached to one another) 
    and aerobic (using free oxygen).  They are usually found in water containing significant amounts of iron or in iron pipes.</p><br>
    <p><strong>Types of Iron Bacteria</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Ferribacillus</li>
    <li>Leptothrix</li>
    <li>Gallionella</li>
    <li>Crenothrix</li>
    </ul><br>

    <h3>Sources of Iron in Water</h3><br>
    <p>Iron is usually not found in surface water supplies unless acidic or anaerobic conditions exist.</p>
    <p>Groundwater supplies are more common areas to find iron, since aquifers will normally not have any oxygen due to reactions of the 
    oxygen with organics and inorganics taht water comes in contact with underground.  Iron will only exist in trace amounts in normally 
    alkaline water, except in the complete absence of oxygen.</p>
    <p>Iron is in the ferrous (Fe++) state when it dissolves in water in the absence of oxygen.  In a normally alkaline water, 
    iron will be in the ferrous bicarbonate form, which is colorless.  Ferrous iron is not a problem.  As long as the iron is dissolved, 
    it will not cause stains.</p>
    <p>The ferric (Fe+++) state of iron is not soluble.  If water with soluble ferrous is exposed to air, the water will turn cloudy, 
    and eventually the iron will precipitate out to the ferric state as the water picks up oxygen.  When the water comes into contact 
    with oxygen, the iron as ferric oxide (rust) now causes problems with staining of fixtures and clothing.</p>
    <p>The pH of water affects the state in which iron will appear.  Iron can oxidize at a pH as low as 6.5 
    (turn from soluble ferrous into insoluble ferric).  The higher the pH of water, the more quickly this oxidation process occurs.  
    Oxygen will convert approximately 7 times its weight in iron from soluble ferrous to insoluble ferric.  Enough oxygen can 
    be inadvertently supplied to oxidize iron by the action of a pump or by a small leak in piping.</p><br>
    
    <h3>Methods of Removal</h3><br>
    <p><strong>1. Aeration, Sedimentation & Filtration</strong> - This is the #1 method for removing inorganic iron, but it's 
    only effective on low levels of manganese.</p><br>
    <p><strong>Aeration</strong></p>
    <ul>
    <li>introduces oxygen</li>
    <li>strips carbon dioxide which raises pH</li>
    <li>removes methane and hydrogen sulfide gases</li>
    <li>oxidation occurs over time and requires detenstion time (time to react):</li><br>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0">
    <td>< 4 ppm Iron</td>
    <td>2 Hours</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>4 - 9 ppm Iron</td>
    <td>4 Hours</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>10 - 20 ppm Iron</td>
    <td>6 Hours</td>
  </tr>
</table><br>
        </ul>
    <p><strong>Sedimentation</strong> - Once sufficiently oxidized, iron and manganese will settle to the bottom of the basin</p>
    <p><strong>Filtration</strong> - Iron and manganese that has been oxidized and precipitated out of water will be removed with filtration.  
    Any iron and manganese that is still disolved in the water will pass through the filters.</p><br>
    <p><strong>2. Softening</strong> - Both iron and manganese are harness elements.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>chemical softening - removes Fe & Mn along with calcium.</li>
    <li>zeolite softening - removes Fe & Mn in the absence of oxygen.  Otherwise, the iron will turn to ferric in the 
    presence of oxygen and foul the filter media.</li><br>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>3. Oxidation</strong> - Oxidation is the chemical equivalent of aeration.</p>
    <p>The two most common oxidants are chlorine (Cl2) and potassium permanganate (KMnO4).</p>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
    <th>For Every</th>
    <th>Oxidation Requires</th></tr>
    <td>1.0 ppm of Iron</td>
    <td>.6 ppm of KMnO4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1.0 ppm of Mn</td>
    <td>2.0 of KMn04</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>1.0 ppm of Iron</td>
    <td>0.64 ppm of Cl2</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>1.0 ppm of Mn</td>
    <td>1.3 ppm of Cl2</td>
  </tr>
</table><br>
<p>Manganese is more difficult than iron to remove from water.</p>
<p>Oxidation is pH dependant.  The lower the pH of water (the more acidic it is), the slower the oxidation process will take place.
In a pH of 6.5, oxidation takes approximately 5 hours, however, at a pH of 7.5 or higher oxidation takes place quickly.</p>
