        <br>
        <h3>Pumps</h3><br>
        <p>A pump is a mechanical device for raising water to a higher elevation, creating flow or applying pressure.</p>
        <p>There are two types of pumps: Positive Displacement and Centrifugal</p><br><br>
        <h3>Positive Displacement Pumps</h3><br>
        <p>Positive Displacement pumps produce a pulsing flow with a definite volume pumped each stroke.
        </p>Positive displacement pumps are primarily used as chemical feed pumps.</p>
        <p> They cannot be pumped against a closed valve, or 
        damage will occur to the pump or the water line.  These pumps are considered to be self-priming.</p><br><br>
        <p><strong>Types of Positive Displacement Pumps</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>piston</li>
        <li>plunger</li>
        <li>diaphram</li>
        </ul><br><br>

        <h3>Centrifugal Pumps</h3><br>
        <p>Centrifual pumps have a rotating impeller within the pump casing.</p>
        <p>Water enters at the eye (center) of the impeller.</p>
        <p>When the impeller is rotating, water is forced out against the walls of the casing by centrifugal force.  
        The water climbs the inner wall of the casing until it is discharged at the outlet of the pump.  
        It's forced out of the pump by the pressure supplied by centrifugal force from the spinning impeller.  
        A vacuum is created at the eye of the impeller by the water being forced out.  This vacuum draws in more water at the suction (inlet) 
        of the pump.</p><br>

        <p><strong>Centrifugal Pump Facts</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>Centrifugal pumps can be pumped against a closed valve</li><br>
        <li>They are not self priming.  A foot valve must keep water in them, or they must be primed before use</li><br>
        <li>The amount of water pumped by a centrigual pump is directly related to the head (water in feet of height) that the pump is pumping against.  
        The higher the head, the less the capacity of the pump will be.</li><br>
        <li>If a centrifugal pump cannot supply an adequate discharge head, two or more pumps can be connected in series, with the discharge of the first pump connected 
        to the suction of the second pump.  This will not increase the velocity or quantity of water flow, but it will create a higher discharge head (more pressure to raise 
        the water level higher for filling a storage tank).</li><br>
        <li>Two parallel pumps of the same capacity pumping into the same pipe will not double the amount of water pumped by a single pump.</li><br>
        <li>Pumps should not be installed where they will be subjected to flooding.</li><br>
        <li>It is good practice to have two pumps at any critical installation.  Alternate pumps to lessen wear.</li>
        </ul><br>

        <p><strong>Parts of a Centrifugal Pump</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Case (or Casing)</strong> - The case converts velocity energy into pressure energy  The shape of the case directs the flow of liquid into and out of the pump.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Shaft</strong> - The shaft supports and rotates the impeller.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Packing Glands</strong> - The packing glands are located where the shaft protrudes through the case.  They seal the fluid flow in the pump and seal out grit.  
        Packing is often made of teflon or graphite and is the material placed between the shaft and the case.  Packing provides a lubricated surface for 
        the shaft to turn on and provides a seal against air, dirt and grit.  Some amount of water leakage through the packing gland is necessary to provide 
        lubrication and cooling of the shaft.  Leakage through the packing should be approximately 10 drops per minute, but always judge sufficient 
        leakage, and all other maintenance concerns according to the manufacturer's specifications.  If leakage is excessive, turn the nuts on the packing gland with
        your fingers and observe the decreased flow.  If tightening doesn't work to restrict flow to the proper amount or if loosening doesn't alow enough water 
        to pass through the packing to keep the packing gland cool, replace the packing.  Always remove all of the old packing and replace it with new packing.  
        Never add new packing on top of old packing.  Cut the packing so that there's a slight gap between opposite ends (about 1/4 inch) when they meet after being 
        wrapped around the shaft.  Stagger packing at 90 degree intervals so that water will not have a straight path to the outside,</li><br>
        <li><strong>Lantern Ring</strong> - The lantern ring is located at the center of the packing material in the packing gland (not all pumps have a lantern ring).  
        A pipe providing pressurized water is connected to the packing gland.  This pressurized water is forced out around the shaft providing the seal and lubrication
        required.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Wear Rings</strong> - Wear rings are sacrificial.  Wear is concentrated on the wear rings.  As pumps wear, efficiency drops off.
        Wear rings might be on the case, the impeller or both.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Bearings</strong> - Bearings support the shaft in the case housing.  Bearings should be lubricated according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
        Excessive grease is one of the main causes of bearing failure.  It's a good idea to leave a grease fitting open for a short time after greasing maintenance 
        to allow excess grease to drain.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Impeller</strong> - The impeller is the rotating element in a centrifugal pump, which applies high energy force to water to give 
        it velocity and momentum.  The eye of the impeller partially determines the amount of flow.  Clogging of the impeller will reduce flow.  
        An impeller's totation is counter-clockwise.<br><br>
        <strong>Three Types of Impeller</strong>
        <ul><br>
        <li><strong>Open</strong> - to move water containing large solids</li>
        <li><strong>Semi-Open</strong> - to move water containing medium sized solids</li>
        <li><strong>Closed</strong> - to move water with few or no solids.  Closed impellers are the most commonly used impellers for pumping finished water.</li>
        </ul></li>
        </ul><br>
        <h3>Cavitation</h3><br>
        <p>Cavitation is the formation of pits on the impeller and the eventual wearing away of the impeller, or the formation of partial vacuums in the water being pumped due to a 
        corroded impeller.  Cavitation can be accompanied by high frequency sound waves.  The cause of cavitation can be clogged intakes or excessive discharge rates compared
        to the pumps discharge rating.  To correct the problem, clear the intake or suction of the pump, or throttle down the discharge valve, depending on the cause of the 
        problem.</p><br>
        <p>Centrifugal pumps are usually driven by an electrical motor.  It is crucial that you align the coupling between the motor and the pump.  
        Improper alignment will cause vibration that will destroy the bearings.  The alignment can be checked with a straight edge and a feeler gauge.</p>
