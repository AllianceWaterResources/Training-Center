        <br>
        <h3>Important Definitions</h3><br>
        <p>	Primacy – the primary authority for implementation and enforcement of drinking water regulations<br><br>
            	Chief Operator – Primary responsibility is the health of the public.
             If a chief operator quits or is hired it must be reported to DNR within 15 days.<br><br>
            	Permit to Dispense – form required before a system can dispense water.  Provides a systems 7 digit ID number<br><br>
            	Primacy Fee – fee customers pay to offset state lab expenses<br><br>
            	Abandoned Well Form – must be filled out when new customers are connected to public system<br><br>
            </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3>Colilert Test</h3><br>
        <p>This is the primary test used by the State Department of Health in Jefferson City to detect coliform.
              This test is also called “PA” and “MUG”.  It’s the fastest of all tests and takes 24 to 48 hours.
                The sample is incubated for 24 hours to allow a color change:<br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If yellow its coliform positive<br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it Fluoresces under ultraviolet light, it is E. Coli positive<br><br>
            
            The Sample is held an extra four hours if the yellow color is not determinant
             (the right shade of yellow) within the original 24 hours.  Some Colilert tests require only 18 hours to complete
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h3>Membrane Filter Technique</h3><br>
            <p>The Membrane Filter Technique for detection of total coliform bacteria is performed
                 only upon request by the State Health Department.  The Colilert Test has replaced it.<br><br>

                The Membrane Filter Technique has two Stages:<br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.	Presumptive Stage – If coliform is present, the broth will render them a distinguishable metallic green color.<br><br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.	Confirmation Stage – A sample of the bacterial growth though to be coliform is transferred to a Durham Tube.
                  If gas collects in the tube, the presence of coliform is confirmed.<br><br>
                
                The entire process takes a minimum of 48 hours.
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <h3>Most Probable Number</h3><br>
                <p>This test is also called “MPN” or “Multiple Tube Fermentation”.<br><br>
                    The MPN Technique has 3 stages:<br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.	Presumptive Stage – Five tubes are used in this test in an incubator at 35° C.<br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.	Confirmation Stage – This stage is similar to its counterpart in the Membrane Filter Technique.<br><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.	Completed – final step to confirm the presence of coliform<br><br>
                    
                    The tests are read as “___ colonies per 100ml.” The MPN technique takes up to 7 days to complete.  
                    </p>

                    <h3>Level 1 & 2 Assessments</h3><br>
                    <p>Level 1 assessments are triggered when a system:<br><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.	Is required to take 40 or more samples a month and more than 5% are total coliform positive<br><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.	Takes fewer than 40 samples a month and two or more are total coliform positive<br><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.	Fails to take the required number of repeat samples after any total coliform positive samples in the month<br><br>
                        <br>
                        Level 2 Assessments are triggered when a system:<br><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.	Has an E. coli MCL violation<br><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.	Has a second Level 1 assessment triggered in a rolling 12 month period<br><br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.	Fails to collect all required repeat samples following any E. Coli positive routine sample.<br><br>
                        Any surface or ground water system under the influence of surface water and iron removal
                         or softening plants must collect a minimum of 5 routine samples per month.<br><br>

                            Public water supplies are expected to issue a Boil Water Advisory under two circumstances:<br><br>

                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.	Pressure less than 20 psi in the system.  If this occurs the system must submit a Report
                             of Low Water Pressure to DNR within 48 hours of the occurance.<br><br><br>
                            
                            When Issuing a Boil Advisory:<br><br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.	Contact one television station most viewed by the community<br><br>

                            <p>A cross connection is any connection between a potable water supply and a questionable source.<br><br><br>

                                Types of Cross Connections:<br><br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.	Backflow – a reverse flow due to a customer having a higher pressure
                                 in the water line (example: boiler system)<br><br>
                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.	Back Siphonage – a reverse flow due to negative pressure
                                 in the water line (examples: fire hydrant pulling water from both directions or a water main break.)<br><br><br>
                                
                                Prevention Measures for Class I Hazards (Health Risks)<br><br>
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.	Air Gap – This is the most preferred method.  It must be a separation
                                 distance of at least 2 times the diameter of the discharge pipe above the flood
                                  level rim of the receiving vessel.  The minimum is 1 inch.  All air gaps should be
                                   installed above grade where flooding isn’t possible.<br><br>
                                   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.	Reduced Pressure Principle (“RP” or “RPZ”) – a device that creates a mechanical air gap
                                 with its zone of reduced pressure.  They must be inspected every year by a licensed inspector.
                                   Backflow records are kept by the water system for 5 years.<br><br><br>
